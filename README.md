# An Out-Of-The-Box Version of CoTracker

## Introduction
Video motion prediction is a crucial task in computer vision, typically relying on either estimating the instantaneous motion of all points in a video frame using optical flow, or tracking the motion of individual points throughout the video independently. However, tracking points individually can overlook the strong correlation that often exists between points, especially when they originate from the same physical object, potentially impacting performance.

[CoTracker](https://co-tracker.github.io/) introduces a novel approach to this problem by proposing an architecture that jointly tracks multiple points throughout an entire video. This architecture is based on several ideas from the optical flow and tracking literature, and combines them in a new, flexible, and powerful design. It is based on a transformer network that models the correlation of different points in time via specialized attention layers.
